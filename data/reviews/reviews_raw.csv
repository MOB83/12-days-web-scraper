Extremely satisfied with consistent quality service.,"In the three years that I've been a WPEngine user, I have experienced only great things. My website has never experienced any issues, everything works well, consistently. Customer support is great. Every time I have a question, however rudimentary or advanced, I've always received detailed and helpful explanations.",5 stars: Excellent,Lisa,South Africa,2021-01-10 10:17:31+00:00

I run my own agency. I trust WP Engine.,"I run my own agency. I got tired of managing servers and just wanted quality hosting with security.I have a VPS for my clients on WP Engine. I love that I can just on chat or the phone and have something added, tweaked, or an issue solved asap. I rarely have any problems and when I do they are solved quickly. With their security, speed, and support I can't imagine going anywhere else.",5 stars: Excellent,Melanie Adcock,United States,2020-12-22 15:24:11+00:00
My experience from being a customer for the last 6+ years,"I run a WordPress agency who offers WordPress hosting to our clients. We began working with WP Engine back in 2014 and our experience has been nothing short of exceptional. WP Engine is the best in class when it comes to performance, customer service and agency support. If you run a web agency, WP Engine should be your #1 go-to hosting partner.",5 stars: Excellent,James Banks,Australia,2020-12-22 03:42:35+00:00

"Excellent support, but expensive for high traffic volumes","I have found the WPengine experience a mixture of brilliance and frustration. WPengine has been endlessly helpful in the process of migrating and improving my WordPress site with direct and knowledgeable personal support. My site also loads very, very fast. However, the pricing structure is less effective for me. My site is funded by affiliate commissions which naturally, require fairly high levels of traffic. Right now, I'm in a Catch-22 situation: if I get more traffic, I will have to upgrade my plan, which means much of the extra revenue from increased traffic will be swallowed up by a more expensive plan. I think WPengine may offer great plans for companies or individuals willing to set aside a marketing budget for a site with a different kind of revenue stream (or better conversion), but it does not work well for sites which depend on high traffic and affiliate revenue.",3 stars: Average,ROD LAWTON,United Kingdom,2020-12-13 16:01:01+00:00

Best WP Hosting solution. By far.,"You know how to tell a good hosting company from a not-so-good one? The amount of times you need to deal with them…I say this because I've been a VERY happy customer of WPEngine for a number of years now and I rarely have to log in to my dashboard for anything other than to add or remove a client's website.Stuff does not break, sites are fast, responsive and my clients are happy.And, just for peace of mind, it's great knowing that my and my clients' websites are being hosted in a WP-optimized environment, with daily backups and that I can roll them back easily.And for the (very!) few times I've needed support, I've found them to be super friendly, responsive and helpful as well which is phenomenal.",5 stars: Excellent,Dr Ernesto MD,United States,2020-12-10 13:04:07+00:00

I like WPEngine,"I like WPEngine, their support is really good, rarely have to wait for long, they help you far beyond other hosting providers, they give you detailed explanations about issues.We had some speed issues with our server so they setup some kind of custom monitoring tool to give us detailed stats on what parts of our code were potentially causing issues.Their infrastructure is great too.They seem to really value their customers and take their issues seriously.",5 stars: Excellent,Andy B,United Kingdom,2020-12-06 12:02:51+00:00
