My experience from being a customer for the last 6+ years,"I run a WordPress agency who offers WordPress hosting to our clients. We began working with WP Engine back in 2014 and our experience has been nothing short of exceptional.

"Excellent support, but expensive for high traffic volumes","I have found the WPengine experience a mixture of brilliance and frustration. WPengine has been endlessly helpful in the process of migrating and improving my WordPress site with direct and knowledgeable personal support. My site also loads very, very fast. However, the pricing structure is less effective for me. My site is funded by affiliate commissions which naturally, require fairly high levels of traffic. Right now, I'm in a Catch-22 situation: if I get more traffic, I will have to upgrade my plan, which means much of the extra revenue from increased traffic will be swallowed up by a more expensive plan. I think WPengine may offer great plans for companies or individuals willing to set aside a marketing budget for a site with a different kind of revenue stream (or better conversion), but it does not work well for sites which depend on high traffic and affiliate revenue.",3 stars: Average,ROD LAWTON,United Kingdom,2020-12-13 16:01:01+00:00

Best WP Hosting solution. By far.,"You know how to tell a good hosting company from a not-so-good one? The amount of times you need to deal with them…I say this because I've been a VERY happy customer of WPEngine for a number of years now and I rarely have to log in to my dashboard for anything other than to add or remove a client's website.Stuff does not break, sites are fast, responsive and my clients are happy.And, just for peace of mind, it's great knowing that my and my clients' websites are being hosted in a WP-optimized environment, with daily backups and that I can roll them back easily.And for the (very!) few times I've needed support, I've found them to be super friendly, responsive and helpful as well which is phenomenal.",5 stars: Excellent,Dr Ernesto MD,United States,2020-12-10 13:04:07+00:00

Absolutely worth the price,"Simply incredible experience for a WP host.My company's websites are all WP sites, so I searched for a good host. At first, I gravitated towards low cost providers like Godaddy, and wondered why WPengine was so expensive.However, turns out there was a massive quality difference. WPengine has an incredible amount of useful features that dramatically simplify site maintainence and development, 2FA, semi-SSO (using one WPengine account to access all WP sites),automated/on-demand backup and restore, managed version updates, built in letsencrypt SSL (which is free!), regex redirects, multi-domain management, and likely more I don't even know. I didn't even know I needed these features before, but now I can't live without them. These are all very difficult to do manually, but now completely automated/simplified.Moreover, they have superb support, real agents on demand via chat. They are pro-active, and try to solve problems ASAP, instead of the type who follows scripts and wastes everyone's time. They also have extensive documentation on their own systems, so for most simple problems, the solution is just one google search away.WPengine is relatively expensive, but the extra cost is trivial compared to the hundreds of hours it has saved me.",5 stars: Excellent,Teng Pan,Australia,2020-12-01 02:45:05+00:00

Each time I have chatted to someone using the live chat they were knowledgeable and got straight to my issue and knew what needed to be done.

"Good dashboard, lame support","The host dashboard is good. It's easy to download backups, revert to backup, copy live site to staging site, add password protection to staging, and so on. The reason for mediocre rating is support. This comes in 2 forms: chat support and ticketed support.Chat support is hit-and-miss. Some people know what they are doing and want to find a solution. Others either don't know or don't seem to care. With all chat support, you're better off multi-tasking due to the long waits between responses, but that seems universal on the web. I've had some great chat support so overall, this would only bring the score down one star.The real downfall is ticketed support. Generally, issues move to ticketed support when it takes too long or is too hard for chat support. (You can't log into ticket support in the Chrome/incognito browser, by the way, or at least I can't.) Any ticket-item I've had has basically had zero support. Your site could be in flames and they probably wouldn't look at it for a week. (And that's just the initial look, not a solution.) So you end up trying again and again with chat support and hopefully you get a resolution there. In summary, it's a pity about WP Engine's support level (mainly ticketed support). The rest of the system/interface is good and much cleaner that what I've seen on the two other hosts that I've tried. For me, timely support is important so I'm actually considering a change to another host.",3 stars: Average,Jax,Australia,2020-11-20 01:38:37+00:00
