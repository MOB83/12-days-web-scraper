wpengine.com,"Excellent support, but expensive for high traffic volumes","I have found the WPengine experience a mixture of brilliance and frustration. WPengine has been endlessly helpful in the process of migrating and improving my WordPress site with direct and knowledgeable personal support. My site also loads very, very fast. However, the pricing structure is less effective for me. My site is funded by affiliate commissions which naturally, require fairly high levels of traffic. Right now, I'm in a Catch-22 situation: if I get more traffic, I will have to upgrade my plan, which means much of the extra revenue from increased traffic will be swallowed up by a more expensive plan. I think WPengine may offer great plans for companies or individuals willing to set aside a marketing budget for a site with a different kind of revenue stream (or better conversion), but it does not work well for sites which depend on high traffic and affiliate revenue.",3 stars: Average,ROD LAWTON,United Kingdom,2020-12-13 16:01:01+00:00

wpengine.com,Absolutely worth the price,"Simply incredible experience for a WP host.My company's websites are all WP sites, so I searched for a good host. At first, I gravitated towards low cost providers like Godaddy, and wondered why WPengine was so expensive.However, turns out there was a massive quality difference. WPengine has an incredible amount of useful features that dramatically simplify site maintainence and development, 2FA, semi-SSO (using one WPengine account to access all WP sites),automated/on-demand backup and restore, managed version updates, built in letsencrypt SSL (which is free!), regex redirects, multi-domain management, and likely more I don't even know. I didn't even know I needed these features before, but now I can't live without them. These are all very difficult to do manually, but now completely automated/simplified.Moreover, they have superb support, real agents on demand via chat. They are pro-active, and try to solve problems ASAP, instead of the type who follows scripts and wastes everyone's time. They also have extensive documentation on their own systems, so for most simple problems, the solution is just one google search away.WPengine is relatively expensive, but the extra cost is trivial compared to the hundreds of hours it has saved me.",5 stars: Excellent,Teng Pan,Australia,2020-12-01 02:45:05+00:00

wpengine.com,"Good dashboard, lame support","The host dashboard is good. It's easy to download backups, revert to backup, copy live site to staging site, add password protection to staging, and so on. The reason for mediocre rating is support. This comes in 2 forms: chat support and ticketed support.Chat support is hit-and-miss. Some people know what they are doing and want to find a solution. Others either don't know or don't seem to care. With all chat support, you're better off multi-tasking due to the long waits between responses, but that seems universal on the web. I've had some great chat support so overall, this would only bring the score down one star.The real downfall is ticketed support. Generally, issues move to ticketed support when it takes too long or is too hard for chat support. (You can't log into ticket support in the Chrome/incognito browser, by the way, or at least I can't.) Any ticket-item I've had has basically had zero support. Your site could be in flames and they probably wouldn't look at it for a week. (And that's just the initial look, not a solution.) So you end up trying again and again with chat support and hopefully you get a resolution there. In summary, it's a pity about WP Engine's support level (mainly ticketed support). The rest of the system/interface is good and much cleaner that what I've seen on the two other hosts that I've tried. For me, timely support is important so I'm actually considering a change to another host.",3 stars: Average,Jax,Australia,2020-11-20 01:38:37+00:00

Instead of making any rash decisions, I had called on several hosting companies, but I did not call the ""SALES"" department. I would call the TECHNICAL department.In addition to making my choice, I went to all of the social media channels of all of the hosting companies that I was looking at.In fact, what I was looking for was the commonality of any problems, response times on social media, and if everyone had the same issues/complaints. In my 3.5 years with WPEngine, I can share that I have only had about 2 or 3 tickets that needed more attention than their chat can handle. One of the most important aspects of RELIABLE HOSTING is RELIABLE SUPPORT. In my professional opinion, and personal experience WPEngine yearly fees are worth every penny because they have always been and are very attentive while providing outstanding customer support.

Their hosting service is unreliable at best. Random outages, environments will redirect so you have production links driving to development sites, slow site speeds, a useless CDN and just the worst support. The support you get from their live chat is a joke. They will lie to you, mislead you and in general tell you what you want to hear to get you off the chat as fast as possible. I've had dozen of calls with account reps, developers and various other customer service people and I never feel like I'm talking to anyone with actual knowledge of their product or care taken in their customer's satisfaction. They refuse to give out any actual helpful information about their service.

wpengine.com,Great support but not accepting PayPal payments sucks.,"WP Engine's support is no short of outstanding: For the past two years I've been with them, I've always dealt with really competent and friendly support guys where nothing was too much trouble. That, for me, always justified the high end hosting pricing. I still have 15 other ""minor"" websites hosted on OVH, which at least do not need the garanties and security provided by WP Engine. And when you come from OVH, you know what it's worth to have someone jump in within less than 10 minutes when you're having an issue. With OVH, you can wait up to 5-7 days until someone shows up to give you a standard copy/paste answer. So I really appreciate WP Engine's support. The price hike though was not necessary I think. WP Engine already offers pricey services (in terms of bandwidth and hosting, their prices are in average 5x higher than other competitors). My website is on autopilot and isn't memory intensive. I also don't use support that much (maybe once every two months). Another negative thing: WP Engine doesn't accept PayPal payments. And for users based outside of the US, this means that we get a $20 conversion fee from our bank on top of the subscription we pay every year to WP Engine. I think it would be fair if WP Engine gave us $20 back in credit if they're not able to offer PayPal as a checkout option.",4 stars: Great,Niclas,Austria,2019-03-01 09:34:21+00:00

That makes everything worse, now getting fatal errors, plugins don't work, themes don't work. Absolutely insane. Back and forth with the support team, and no one seems to know jack sh** about anything, you have to be a specialized SFTP, the fu****g advanced WordPress ex PHP file user to even get your way around this. Tried several times with this, backing up, uploading and so forth, with no luck what so ever. Then after like 5th try suddenly my page wasn't responding, and everything went full slide and wrong fonts and so on. This they couldn't help with, the only thing they would know how to do, was to do a ""fresh"" backup from before. I spent nearly three days back and forth with this s*** and now they want me to do a backup again. At this point, I felt my head exploding, and my inner Mike Tyson came through, wanting to punch these guys through the screen.

It’s one of those aspects of your website you do not want to skimp.Web hosting is the backbone of your site. Ensuring the quality of your web host is absolutely crucial with today’s high standards for SEO and user experience.With that being said, If you were to ask me who is the best WordPress hosting provider for the money? I’d say WP Engine without a doubt judging by sheer performance.WP Engine is the best premium WordPress host, hands down. However, it comes with a premium price. Can you can swing $35 bucks a month?Read our full in-depth WP Engine review at wprocket.co",5 stars: Excellent,Roman Tikhonov,United States,2018-04-25 21:32:12+00:00

wpengine.com,Poor product knoweldge from staff - service offering has huge gaps,"I signed up for WPengine after speaking with a helpful sales guy (UK based). The server needed to include 2x installations of Wordpress, one for the website and another for the blog (it was actually a news site for SEO, but for the purposes of this review we will just call it a blog) www.(main)fistwpinstall.co.uk/(blog)secondWPinstall/I was informed I could do this on the personal plan, no problem. Yey! On signing up, paying for a year on the personal plan with UK Data centre, I figure this is not possible by doing some research. I spoke to a colleague via the chat box to clarify, and they tell me I need to buy a Professional Plan unless I add an additional website (at an additional $14 a month) and add set up a forwarder on the DNS for the sub domain, not happy I use a second account (Which I purchased with the original order but was hoping to use it for another website, but this is a different story) So I install the blog and try to set this up via the DNS - Im struggling at this point so I speak to another Technical advisor via the Chatbox and he informs me, no, this can not be done! - As you can imagine, not happy at this point! I speak to the original chap on the phone again who advises I upgrade to the professional plan. A little unhappy, I ask to speak to his Boss. I don't understand why it is so difficult to add a second installation of WordPress on the server and why this is going to cost me an additional $700, so when you include UK data Centre this works out at $1500 total. I understand the benefits of using WPEngine; I get it! I just don't know how you can go from a plan that allows 1x WordPress install to a plan that accepts ten installs. I don't need ten installs; I only need 1 install and sub folder with wordpress installed for the website blog, how is this so difficult for WPengine to understand, surley most companies have this? why are you talking to me like I am the first person to ever ask this question. IN short, I have spoken with two people on the phone - employee 1x didn't have a clue what he was talking about. The other (his manager) didnt understand the point I was trying to raise, he was very abrupt and kind of told me to go away, they're not interested, ""The product is not for me, and I need to find another server, WP Engine isn't suitable for you riff-raff"" (he didn't say riff-raff, I made that up, but that was how I interpreted it. Secondly the support staff on the chat facility the first person did not have a clue, she took a long time to get back with replies, she must have been the 1st day on the job. She kept referring me back to blog posts for answers. She gave me the wrong advice and wasted a good few hours of my time. The 2nd chap I spoke to on the chat - in all fairness he was very knowledgeable, he shot from the hip, was very to the point and didn't skirt around any of the points I was raising. If any of the management at WPEngine are reading this I would ask that you, please look over this case, you very clearly have issues that need addressing.

wpengine.com,I trust WP Engine with the key part of my business,"I have hosted sites with WP Engine for over 2 years now. I started out with a 10 site package and hosted some of my smaller sites with it. I hosted my main websites on 2 VPS's. My initial thought was to try out WPEngine with my smaller sites and then move my key sites over once I saw how it worked.I was drawn to WPEngine because of the daily backups, staging sites and support - I didn't have any of this easily with my VPS. I was also finding that it was expensive to hire people to run updates on my VPS to keep it up to date.It actually took me over a year to transfer my main site to WPEngine - my reason for it taking so long was that I was worried about the migration process and any downtime during this. Last summer WPEngine added a new site migration tool to my dashboard and this looked like what I needed to use. I knew that my existing 10 site contract wasn't going to be sufficient once I moved my main site over as its size and visitors would have taken me up to the limits of this contract.I sent a message to WP Engine asking some questions about my upgrade options and they booked a phone appointment with me. They answered my questions easily and I decided to upgrade to their Premium plan - I didn't feel pressurised into this upgrade - it was my decision as I wanted peace of mind that I can continue to grow my sites without looking at visitor numbers or site sizes - I know I have capacity and if there is a spike in traffic I am covered.The migration process was easy. If you follow the steps in the video it works perfectly and quickly - as I say my main site is pretty large and image heavy, the whole migration was less than 2 hours with no downtime.I was concerned at first at how much I am paying for the Premium plan. However when I added up what I spent on the VPS's I had, back up services, maintenance etc its about what I was paying.I moved all my sites to WPEngine in November 2015 - its been a good decision for my business. My sites are faster, I have the peace of mind that they are secure and that I have technical help when I need it. I also know that my sites are backed up everyday and the staging sites are a godsend. My move to WPEngine has been a good business decision and I now focus on content and growing my sites.I did experience a few days of downtime in December 2015 when the servers were attacked. The support staff were quite straight with me with what was going on - which is all you can ask in such situations.",5 stars: Excellent,Jo Berrington,United Kingdom,2016-03-27 15:46:56+00:00

wpengine.com,Our most trusted WP hosting expert.,"Managing my own server used to keep me up at night. I was constantly worried; about the software, whether all of my tools were up-to-date; what to do if something went awry (which happens with technology, because, well, it’s technology).At the time, I was building Saucal, yet there I was managing a WordPress server, fighting fires, and wasting valuable time on tasks other than designing killer sites for our customers.Then one of our clients was hacked and I stayed up all night fixing it. That was the the last straw. I vowed not to self-manage my server again, and I immediate sought a better way.We found WP Engine after some shopping around, and WP Engine’s managed WordPress hosting platform was a perfect fit.And since we moved to WP Engine, we’ve noticed a huge difference, not only in the time saved by no longer grappling with service management, but in the performance of our customers’ sites.WP Engine is a WordPress expert. You won’t find that anywhere else. Other platform providers simply say they know WordPress, where WP Engine knows it inside and out. That shows in the amazing support we’ve received from WP Engine over the more than two years we’ve hosted our site and several customer sites on the platform.Along with incredible support, the user experience is top-notch. We use staging to design sites before pushing them live, so we can test them and ensure they’re perfect before deploying. And we get peace of mind from automated and on-demand backups, which enable us to restore our work to any point we choose. All that and a simple and intuitive UI, makes adding customers and additional staff to access the a WordPress install a breeze.WP Engine saves us time and money, and boosts our dev team’s morale. The platform works out of the box without any of the headaches.If I sound like a WP Engine fanboy, it's because I am! :)",5 stars: Excellent,Mitchell,Canada,2016-02-16 13:51:59+00:00

kinsta.com,Meine Empfehlung: Fernhalten!,"Hatte dort das Paket mit 5 Websites. Fast gleicher Preis wie 10 Websites bei Wpengine. Dafür waren meine Websites deutlich (!) langsamer als bei Wpengine. Habe auch versucht, Hilfe vom Support zu bekommen, da 1.6 Sekunden reine Wartezeit bei der Verbindung war. Fehlanzeige. Stattdessen gab's nur Standardantworten und Links zu Artikeln und die Aufforderung, dass ich mir einen Developer nehmen soll. Bin dann direkt zu Wpengine migriert und hab dann dort nochmal den Speedtest gemacht. Und siehe da von 3.2 Sekunden Ladezeit auf Gtmetrix bei Kinsta runter auf 2 Sekunden bei Wpengine. N.B.: Ich habe rein gar nichts verändert und trotzdem *massiven* Gewinn an Geschwindigkeit. Sorry... aber dafür den doppelten Preis verlangen ist unverschämt und nicht fair. Kann es nicht empfehlen!Als Antwort auf den Kommentar von Kinsta:- Sie scheinen noch immer nicht zu verstehen, dass die Ladezeit, wegen der ich den Support kontaktiert hatte nach meinem Wechsel zu WPEngine sofort (!) verschwunden war. Es waren keine weiteren Anpassungen notwendig. Keine Plugins (außer jenem von Kinsta) wurden entfernt. Es hatte also eindeutig mit etwas zu tun, das in Ihren Aufgabenbereich gefallen wäre (es sei denn Ihre Server und Ihr Setup generell ist einfach schlechter als bei WPengine, was natürlich auch sein kann).",1 star: Bad,Dennis,Austria,2020-10-13 21:35:40+00:00

kinsta.com,"Amazing customer service, blazing fast speed, and top notch user interface","Kinsta is by far the best host I have ever used. I started in the web development space building my own website. Then I built my wife a site, and then a site for some friends. Before I knew it I was learning WordPress and beginning to try and find the best hosting service out there. I took a long look at WP Engine, but after speaking with both sales teams, and reading some online reviews, I decided to go with Kinsta. I am so happy with this platform. They have phenomenal technical support, and the quality is superb. GoDaddy, Squarespace, and Wix are all ok platforms, but for someone who is trying to take things to the next level Kinsta is the best platform out there. Moving from a site builder was a process, but Kinsta was there to help me every step of the way. I tried a few other providers, and I always felt left on my own. WordPress is a big step up from other web development options. In order to grow my business, I had to take it to the next level. After reading around I decided to go with Kinsta, and I have been so happy with them.I cannot recommend them enough. Their tech support team is amazing and has wildly exceeded my expectations. With 24/7 support, they beat their competitors in availability and quality every time. Andrew, John, Olufemi, Rafael, Bogdan, and Nikola have been incredibly helpful. AS in their customer service is so great that I went back to look up their names to make sure I call them out individually, as their customer service is the best I have experienced.They are the only platform I will use for my clients, and the only platform I recommend.

kinsta.com,Extremely happy I made the switch to Kinsta,"I came across Kinsta when researching a plugin issue on Google. I found an article in their Knowledge Base, and it fixed the problem I was having with my previous well-known, long-standing, WordPress hosting company. I then began to use Kinsta's Knowledge Base as a go-to resource and bookmarked them in my favorites tab. I did this because the information they provided I found to be useful, easy to understand, and, most importantly, it worked. I didn't know anything about Kinsta at this point other than the knowledge base section. I was so frustrated with my existing hosting provider mainly because they never were able to resolve any issues with my website, and their website works appropriately about 50% of the time. I want to say I typed in the search query ""Best Managed WordPress Hosting Plans in 2020"" in Google about 40 days ago.I went to several links to read their recommendations. These were sites that I knew and trusted based on previous experiences when looking for a product or solution. They had reviews about Kinsta and their hosting plan. Everything the reviews mentioned in a comparison style manner about Kinsta stood out to me, and I went to their website to see if they had a product that would work for me. I have never been happier that I switched to Kinsta. I would start by saying that the company makes your website migration seamless. I didn't have to fix one thing. I'm not saying that's the case for everyone, but that was my experience. And they did it the same day. Also, everything they included in the plan I chose is at a flat monthly rate, which I like very much. It also included many tools I previously wasn't aware of that are incredibly helpful and eliminated the need for existing plugins. I've read some reviews where people complain about the price of Kinsta. I'm afraid I have to disagree with those reviewers because my previous hosting provider would charge extra for every single thing included in Kinsta's plan. I ended up avoiding calling or dealing with them because every time I did, I felt like I had to buy something new. When I did a cost-comparison after the first week of being with Kinsta, I was saving $15/month, which made Kinsta's flat-rate price valuable to me. This company communicates with you a lot, and they do what they say they will do, especially in terms of page speed and loading times. Their dashboard is easy to use, and customer service (which I had only used once when I signed up) is beneficial and responsive. If you are looking for a Managed WordPress Hosting Service, then Kinsta is my number one choice. I know they provide many services, but this is the service I purchased. It's headache-free, and they manage the back-end of your website instead of you having to diagnose the problem then find a bridge or workaround to fix a problem you are paying a hosting company to manage for you. In that aspect, Kinsta is worth its weight in gold. I also have found I've learned a lot I did not know (and have done this a while) through signing up with Kinsta. They are a forward-thinking company with a lot of suggestions and tools to help make your website better and inform you overall about the industry as a whole. I have had a very positive experience with Kinsta and like the flat-rate price model. They are honest and do what they say they are going to do. That was all I expected, and they have exceeded my expectations.",5 stars: Excellent,Paul Grenier,United States,2020-09-07 13:26:39+00:00

kinsta.com,Kinsta is not what it used to be,"I have used Kinsta for a long time and they used to be the best of the best. But the support is not as good as it used to be and their hosting plans are now extremely overpriced compared to many competitors. They have arbitrary limitations on things like PHP workers and are absolutely unwilling to budge if you need extra headroom for your server.I recently switched to my own Google Cloud VPS powered by Gridpane. It is much faster than my Kinsta server and costs a fraction of the price, with tech support that is just as good. But the learning curve is much steeper.If you don't know anything about hosting and just have a simple blog with mostly static pages that can be cached, then Kinsta is a good host.

kinsta.com,Excellent Premium Hosting Provider,"I started an online media business and it was imperative my website was both fast and secure. Additionally, whilst the business is small at present I wanted the ability to scale for when it grows. I did my research and after originally going with another host who completely screwed up the transfer from my domain registrar I decided to give Kinsta a chance. Kinsta facilitated the transfer on my behalf as part of the monthly fee - no need for plugins or a guided tour, it was done manually on my behalf. My website is insanely fast - just like a professional website should be. After my first week of going live I realised there was an issue with my Google Analytics setup and I had no access to website visitors - thank God Kinsta had a unique visitor counter as part of the dashboard. There are so many premium features that come included with Kinsta hosting such as regular automatic backups and an offer to fix a website should it be hacked. The amount of educational material on their website and also the number of other major websites that use Kinsta hosting also helped secure my decision. I would have appreciated a little more website capacity as far as visitors are concerned and considering the price I think email should be included but G-Suite is less than $10 a month and I will likely need to upgrade to the next plan soon anyway. I would absolutely recommend Kinsta and can't see myself changing hosting providers within the next 5 to 10 years.

Apart from solving all (yes, all) the problems I wrote to them about - even though most of them were due to a plugin and/or myself - they took the time to answer all of my many questions that came while getting used to the new platform in very great detail - no referring to KB articles, but specific answers to each questions.

kinsta.com,DO NOT USE KINSTA - Siteground WAY better!!!,"Horrible experience after transferring from Siteground.Firstly, Kinta's customer service is terrible compared to sitegroundsI had an issue with my plugins after transferring (which i did not have with Siteground) They were slow to respond to live chat messages. They also kept passing the buck by saying it was a coding issue and to read a few faq articles. Siteground would have gone above and beyond to help me resolve the issues that their system was causing...My site was showing a white screen after the switch, and i was told:""I do apologize for the trouble you are having, let us know if there if you have any more questions or if there is anything else we can help with to resolve the issues""Which was very annoying.Several times when I contacted support, it sounded like they were annoyed at me asking for help.Siteground customer support would always be quick to reply and go above and beyond to fix the issue and make sure you were satisfied. They were also much more friendly. I found Kinsta support frankly rude.My site also slowed down after moving over from Siteground.Needless to say, I have switched back to Siteground and am much happier.Please avoid making the same time-wasting mistake that I did.",1 star: Bad,Struan Hogg,United Kingdom,2020-06-21 11:14:24+00:00

If you don't pay your bill in 14 days of the due date, their policy is to delete your sites and it's in your terms of service. This is has been a source of stress for me as a small business in the social good space every since the gov't shut down and then pandemic. It's been hard to find my footing. In this economy with many businesses struggling, they could adopt a more small business-friendly policy like WPEngine in which I have suggested to no avail.

Je suppose qu'il s'agit peut-être d'un effet latérale qui n'est pas directement issu de l'action qu'a la maintenance sur le réseau (peut-être est-ce une sorte de verrouillage automatique afin de permettre aux ingénieurs de travailler sans interaction avec les utilisateurs).je contacterais dès que possible le support à propos de ce dont vous m'avez parlé je vous remercie énormément.Passez une bonne soiréeL'excellence du service de support en ligne est quelque chose que j'apprécie beaucoup et la disponibilité, ainsi que l'ouverture d'esprit et de coeur sont des qualités rares et également appréciées.Merci à vous",4 stars: Great,Mathieu CALTEAU,Réunion,2020-02-04 00:42:02+00:00

I need not have worried because Kinsta have a comparable if not slightly faster speed in loading my site and some of my heavier pages do actually load much faster than from the old hosts. I do like the lazy loading feature on server level especially on my blog as this really improves the loading of the page in quick time. I have on average 1 second loads of most if not all pages on my site. The Kinsta admin dashboard is simple and very effective in comparable to the sometimes over egged old Cpanel which I used to have and much easier to understand. Migration of the site over to these guys is a complete simple breeze, they do it all once you send them the site details, although if you are not sure they are on hand to assist you anyway via the online message box in the admin area of your dashboard.

I was happy with my previous provider, WP Engine, but felt that their platform was falling a little behind the time, and their service starting to decline as well.Kinsta has been an immediate and significant upgrade in user experience as a developer and business owner with over 40 sites in active management. The backend tools spot on the money, and they have a number of little time-saving automations such as search and replace for the database, amazingly quick backups, forcing HTTPS at the server level, and a bunch of others that obviate the need to use plugins.The best part is their service though. At first I was a little leery about leaving behind my 24/7 phone support at WPE. However, the chat support at Kinsta is even better, and has revolutionized my perceptions about how to offer spectacular support these days. Responses are fast, always professional and friendly, and ALWAYS extremely knowledgable.I would give these guys a solid 7 out of 5 stars if that was an option.

kinsta.com,The saga continues (2 of 5 stars)...,"The saga continues (2 of 5 stars)...Review left at trustpilot.On first glance, I fell in love due to the staging process. I now understand that most registrars have this type of process also.On first experience, the support 'seemed' to be top notch as well but then when I found out that my developer was having chat conversations that I could not join into, I was not happy to say the least.We subsequently got into some pretty complicated stuff and got passed around like a ping pong ball. Not such a bad thing if there was someone in charge, but there isn't, so nobody really guiding the ship.They wouldn't give me the name of a manager until finally one emailed a week later. Her name is jadedavis and apparently from a different time zone. She would not schedule a chat, much less a screen sharing session.The below text includes some of the details of challenges that still exist for us.Your support staff joeri and others assured us very firmly via chat, before your recommended change from staging-tedpenner.kinsta.cloud to staging.tedpenner.com, that there would not be any change to the re-staging process and that it would continue to work as it had, and not become any more cumbersome. What we actually experienced was somewhat different.Despite our best efforts with your staff to communicate asynchronously, and to check all of this out before-hand, and thus avoid the three (3) day loss in potential development time. The change suggested broke at least four (4) different things that had adjusted each time we re-staged. As a result, and despite our best efforts to avoid all of this lost productivity, we are now using this new staging process as follows.New Staging Process - Now required instead of old methodvideo of the current process not allowed to be posted in reviewSelect the live site, do a backup, and restore that backup to staging (3 min, 20 seconds - seems long).Get Progress Indicator - Should be shown by default.Switch to the staging environment in order to get the Backup Restoration in Progress indicator.Set Primary Domain after Staging - This should not be required as an extra step. I sometimes need to change primary to staging-tedpenner.kinsta.cloud first, and then back to staging.tedpenner.com",2 stars: Poor,Ted Penner,United States,2019-07-15 18:28:42+00:00

kinsta.com,(WAS) Best WP Hosting and Super Fast,"Update: I tried to contact support about changing PHP Post Max Size which there is no mention about any limit on any pages in Kinsta. They said, it's unavailable on my plan and sorried about there is no info about it (In fact, there is a page they talk about ""some hostings limit those things""; like they don't !). Their excuse was ""this information will be put on the page soon""; so they are forcing a limit that is not there at all and will be there in the future.If you are looking for ""some hosting with limits"", you can go with them. But the truth came up that there are just another hosting provider with WordPress, without any Premium service.I was using GoDaddy and moved to Kinsta for speed and CDN reasons. Kinsta offers free SSL and CDN usage on their packages which makes more sense than using GoDaddy.On the other hand, their migration team is really fast and even I had a trouble on GoDaddy side, they deeply investigated and guided me for the process to migrate my website without any problems.If you are looking for a personal website host with almost no traffic, Kinsta won't be your choice but if you are a professional or a company (like us); Kinsta is the best choice with good pricing and awesome features.",2 stars: Poor,Efecan Basoz,Turkey,2019-07-11 09:35:51+00:00

kinsta.com,Not best practices. I'm canceling.,"Not best practices. I'm canceling. I sought a hosting provider that would adhere to best practices for Wordpress hosting. Just installing Wordpress and creating the environments (plugins) I needed demonstrated that Kinsta misses the boat.The situation: My client has a live site with a WooCommerce store turned off three years ago. So directed Kinsta to create another new site, [myclient's-domain-name-com].kinsta.cloud. The plan was that I would build the new site with an active WooCommerce store, then, once the client approved, switch DNS to point at the new site hosted at Kinsta. What happened: While Kinsta allowed me to created the kinsta.cloud site, along with all the plugins I had planned, nowhere through the entire process did it allow me to specify that the site would be SSL, i.e., https instead of http. This despite the fact that they advertise that the monthly fee includes SSL support.In order to remedy the problem, I had to contact their support (via chat) and then convince the support rep that in fact there's nothing in their standard process that allows SSL to be enabled, either by the user's (my) choice, or by default. The support rep went away for 15 minutes to prove to himself that in fact what I was saying was true, that there is no mechanism for this. When he finally came back, he directed me to use a utility that changes all of the (absolute) URL references in Wordpress so that SSL could be supported. When I asked him why I needed to do this work, when in fact it should have been the default condition, he had nothing to say. He did do the work himself after I pushed back. This is 2019. For roughly five years Google has said that it downgrades non-SSL sites. Why Kinsta defaults to exactly the wrong answer is not known -- their support person couldn't even explain. He asked if I wanted the problem escalated a feature request!My position: If their management practices are retrograde in this area, what other ""mysteries"" await me? Given the rich price charged at Kinsta, I can do better. I'm going to SiteDistrict.Response to Kinsta's response: Expectations were not set correctly. I laid out my plan with Kinsta before I decided to go with them. Their argument amounts to a murky justification that it's OK to not have SSL enabled if an organization's live domain is operating someplace else until development is complete. This is contrary to best practices and absurd on its face. That is, deliberately defaulting to a non-SSL login increases risk -- period. I was clear about my plan to create a development site at Kinsta while the live site ran in parallel for a while, yet they didn't think it was important to let me know about this ""detail.""

kinsta.com,In the World of hosting,"In the World of hosting providers, you can be easily distracted with the volume of services available from multiple sellers. The hard part is deciphering which company to choose. I at first, took a much easier route with a TITAN in the industry to only find deceitful marketing practices, poor customer service, and less than favorable performance. That sent me on a journey to find what I would say, is the most elite hosting provider in the industry. I have tested, reviewed internally and subjected myself to many platforms. I have to say, without doubt, or hesitation in my mind to say that Kinsta is the best hosting provider in the Universe (that we know of lol). I made one simple deduction to come to this conclusion and it was how they treat people. I for months, badgered and littered their inboxes with questions that ranged in complexity and I received a professional and thorough response each and EVERY TIME. This bodes well for people who understand the VALUE of service, and not just the price tag. Speed, security, support, and usability are all top tier quality! They do a wonderful job in explaining all of that in the most enriching and resourceful content for WordPress to date. My test was how compatible they were to my demands and needs, and they satisfy them all! I often enjoy just quizzing their support staff to not only enhance my own understanding of their platform but also how to make my efforts in the web space better. I cannot THANK Kinsta and their staff for all of their hard work, and I am a PROUD customer. This is not a blind favorite, I've tested them all and only Kinsta gives their customer, regardless of proficiency, their undivided attention. In my opinion, they deserve every dollar I spend on their service.

The free migration I received was the first time a host migrated a site and got all the little details correct, not forgetting things, etc. and they were incredibly friendly and patient. My site has been 100% fast and reliable since the migration a few months ago, and I haven't had to contact support once.

The technical support at Kinsta is excellent too. I put in a plug in my website and the pictures of my gallery were not loading, so they told me that it could be a plug in that I put in, so I knew which plug in I installed into WP, so I took it out. The pictures were loading in my word press dashboard when I took out the plug in, but the picture were not loading on the actual website, so the tech guy at Kinsta removed a cache file and that solved the problem.I would highly recommend anybody who uses Word Press and want an optimize experience with speed and efficiency.Kinsta has many advance features on their dashboard. However, Kinsta is a great for beginners too. They offer free CDN and SSL certificate even at started level. Do not waste your time with other WP Server companies.

kinsta.com,Incredible performance and stability,[Updated review]In 2019 I moved a monster of a WooCommerce store to Kinsta because of the great things I've heard about them. It didn't go well to say the least. The response time was dreadfully long - even without any traffic. A temporary upgrade to Business 2 made things better but still not enough. We decided to ditch Kinsta and picked managed hosting instead.I recently gave Kinsta a new chance with another busy WooCommerce site. For this site I've chosen the Business 1 plan (Kinsta has since made it clear what plan they recommended for dynamic sites like a WooCommerce store) and this time it works perfectly. The site is extremely fast and stable. I'm so happy it works so well and will definitely recommended Kinsta going forward.I'm not exactly sure what the issue was with the first site. I guess it was in a really bad shape and could use a lot of optimisations.,5 stars: Excellent,Jeppe Skovsgaard Christensen,Denmark,2019-02-16 10:16:09+00:00

kinsta.com,Not great at all for single websites!,"Kinsta has an excellent support and a great server technology.What is hard to spot in advance: Kinsta is only great if you host many WordPress installs. Don't choose Kinsta if you have one or more websites with the need for more than minimum server power.Why that? Well...Kinstas plans share almost everything between all WordPress installs within the plan: disc space, visitors, etc.But not php processing (php workers). With smaller packages you get only 2 php workers and 256 mb php memory per WordPress installs. This can easily be insufficient.Upgrade? Sorry. The smallest plan with more workers is business 2. You pay for 10 possible installs with 4 workers per install. This costs $ 200 / month. A reasonable price if you have more websites but not if you run one or two websites as each single website only gets 2x times more power than with the starter plan for $ 30 / month.I loved Kinsta from the first moment until I found out that my highly optimized wp / woocommerce site with a total frontend weight of 350k, only 15 products and no visitors so far needed more php power than the starter package provided.Then I realized that there is no way to get more power than to upgrade to a plan which is incredible expensive for a single install and offers only twice the php power for a seven time higher price.I switched to another cloud hoster which offers two kinds of plans. Some multi install plans like Kinsta (which are great as soon as you have a lot of websites, because these websites have sufficient power per install by default in higher plans) and single install plans which offer all kind of levels of power for single installs.So my advice: if you have only a small number of website make sure that you are either happy with very limited webhost power or ok with paying for a myriad of possible installs just because you want to power up your single website a little bit.Peter@ Kinstas Reply:1. According to New Relic Woocommerce, Woocommerce Membership & Woocommerce Germanized are the most heavy plugins (as one would expect).2. Woocommerce pages aren't cached (as one would expect). These were:- 13 product pages- 4 product category pages- 1 shop page3. All others pages are cached. So no idea of what ""other"" plugins you are writing in your reply. In contrary, my site runs almost no plugins compared to an average shop page.4. But anyway, as you may have missed while reading my review the most disappointing fact wasn't the unexpected lack of performance but the lack of reasonable upgrade plans for user with one or just a few websites.And that's exactly what my headline says ""Not great at all for single websites"".",1 star: Bad,Peter harlander,Austria,2019-01-29 11:42:31+00:00

They'll write custom NGINX rules for you. And you'll actually leave the conversation with a smile on your face. Not kidding.They follow up on feature requests & actually implement customer feedback to improve the platform.Kinsta took the time to custom build their Dashboard because they wanted to be a true ""Managed"" WordPress host, and not a cPanel lookalike. You can access all kinds of stats about your site, see performance bottlenecks (which they will help you fix), manage multiple users on the account, switch between PHP versions with one-click, add SSLs to all your sites with ease... the list goes on and on.I really can't say enough good things about them.
